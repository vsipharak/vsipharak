- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vsipharak and this is my online portfolio (which is still a work in progress).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my basic coding skills, building theoretical networks, researching cybersecurity concerns, and perusing the net to discover new emerging tech.
- ðŸŒ± Please feel free to view, edit, download, comment, and/or modify any of the codes you see on my profile. :)
